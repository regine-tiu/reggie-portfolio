            <h4>The Client &mdash; Prismatic Arts Festival</h4>
            <p>The Prismatic Arts Festival is a national, multidisciplinary arts festival that showcases innovative work by Indigenous artists and artists of colour across Canada.
                </p>

            <h4>The Task &mdash; A UX update and a design overhaul on Wordpress</h4>
            <p>When Prismatic reached out to me in 2021, they needed help updating the look 
                and feel of their site, as well as assistance with making their site more 
                user-friendly. They observed that their audience had difficulty planning out 
                how to spend their time at the festival through the website. They also remarked on how 
                disconcerting it felt to navigate the site since there was no unifying style guide.

            <h4>The Solution &mdash; Improving upon Prismatics' UX/UI Design</h4>
            <h4 class="casestudy-subheader">Part One: Improving User Experience</h4>
            <p>To address the challenge of planning one’s festival time online, I put myself into 
                the audience’s shoes and came up with these three user statements:</p>

            <ul class="paragraph-list">
                <li>As a festival attendee, I would like to see a full festival schedule on the website;</li>
                <li>As a festival attendee,  I want to purchase tickets for events I’m interested in easily;</li>
                <li>As a festival attendee, I want to know where the festival events are taking place so that I may plan 
                my travel time accordingly.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first thing I set out to do was to include ticket information as well as a distinct call-to-action button on every artist's event page. 
                Whether the event required a ticket, or was free upon registration, the call-to-action button made it clear where the 
                audience should go in order to reserve their spot.
            </p>  
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-images">
            <div class="grid-span">
                <img src="../casestudies/casestudy_imgs/prismatic/prismatic-aysanabee.png" alt="A Prismatic Artist Page with a 'Buy Tickets' button">
                <p class="image-caption">An artist page with a call-to-action button</p>
            </div>  
        </div> 

        <div class="casestudy-paragraph">
            <p>Secondly, I created a separate page to host all of Prismatic's event venues. This allows festival attendees to easily locate 
                and plan their festival route. The page features a table of contents listing all of Prismatic's past and present venue locations. 
                Each location entry includes the venue name, address, a Google Maps preview, and extensive accessibility information provided by 
                Prismatic. Additionally, each artist's event page now included a hyperlink to their event location, alongside their performance details. 
                Clicking on this hyperlink directs users to the specific venue information corresponding to their selected event. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy-images">
            <div class="grid-3-4">
                <img src="../casestudies/casestudy_imgs/prismatic/prismatic-venue-header.png" alt="Prismatic Venue Page Summary">
            </div>  
            <div class="grid-3-4">
                <img src="../casestudies/casestudy_imgs/prismatic/prismatic-venue-card.png" alt="Prismatic Venue location info">
                <!-- <p class="image-caption">An artist page with a call-to-action button</p> -->
            </div> 
        </div> 

        <div class="casestudy-paragraph">
            <p>Lastly, the third major feature we implemented as a team was an interactive festival schedule on the website. Within the constraints of a 
                website template (Elementor), I crafted the schedule to closely resemble a calendar. Users could utilize the drop-down toggle on the table 
                to compare schedules for their preferred dates and collapse irrelevant information. Moreover, the color-coded schedule enabled 
                the public to easily identify which events they could attend. For instance, Prismatic's Industry events were designated in brown, denoting 
                networking opportunities reserved for students and working professionals. Each event listing in the schedule included hyperlinks to the specific event and its location. 
                This allowed the public to delve deeper into event details or refresh their memory by simply clicking on the hyperlinks.
            </p>

        <div class="casestudy-paragraph">
            <h4 class="casestudy-subheader">Part Two: Designing visually engaging and resusable templates</h4>
            <p>Previously, Prismatic’s webpages relied heavily on their brand-coloured font on a white background. While these solid hues offered significant contrast, 
                they failed to convey the dynamic nature of the arts organization they represent. Reflecting on Prismatic’s mandate: <i>'To bring new works of leading 
                    Indigenous artists and artists of colour from across Canada to a wide audience,</i> I made the decision to infuse more vibrancy into Prismatic’s website. 
                    I blended their brand colours to form gradients, adding visual interest, while also prioritizing web accessibility.
                </p>

                <p>In terms of improving the site’s consistency, I restyled the artist catalogue into uniform boxes, laid out clearer visual hierarchy, and made the header, subheader and paragraph text styles consistent throughout.</p>    
       
                <p>I also decided to create a fresh, inspired color-gradient palette each year to enhance the excitement surrounding Prismatic's festival launch.
                </p>
